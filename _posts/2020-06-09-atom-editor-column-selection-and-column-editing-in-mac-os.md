### situation

If you are using an atom editor in Mac OS, you may need the **Column Editing** feature when editing a document.

For example,

```bash
good?!!
good?!!
good?!!
```
if there is such a document, the feature used when you want to change **?** to **!** at once is the **Column Editing** feature.

### solution

Place the cursor in the first column of the position to edit, and press the ***ctrl + shift + down arrow*** key.
