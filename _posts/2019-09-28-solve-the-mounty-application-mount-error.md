**Mounty** is a tiny tool to re-mount write-protected NTFS volumes under Mac OS X in read-write mode.

However, sometimes you will see this error when you run it.

{: .box-error}
**Error:** Volume not re-mountable. The volume is not re-mountable in read/write mode. Probably it was not clean unmounted before.

If this error occurs, you can use the following workaround.

### Error resolution

{: .box-note}
After reconnecting the external disk in the Windows OS, select ***"Safely Remove"*** from the system tray to extract the external disk and connect it to Mac OS again.
